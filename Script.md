## Plot

Jacob woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.
After his typical breakfast of toast and an egg he left for school.
Normally Jacob would have walked down Bleaker street, but today there was construction and he decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of Jacob's specialties today would prove to be no different.
As he moved slowly.
As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick floiage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and heard the sounds of animals in the distance.
Jacob had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephantâ€™s trumpet.
He stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally Jacob would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that an animal might escape.
He stuck his head in the door, the color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and chartreuse, he called out for a zoo keeper but got no response.
The smell of the of the zoo was intense and alive.
He took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.

Jacob met the Unicorn King who granted him magic powers.
He asked the Unicorn King if he can grant powers to Mason as well.
He told Jacob that there isn't a need for him and if he can prove that he needs Mason then he will grant him powers as well.
Jacob explains that even with his powers, he doesn't know the first thing about animals and therefore needs Mason to help him understand them.
The Unicorn King looks at Mason begrudgingly but still granted him powers. 
Now, what will they do to get past this barrier.
